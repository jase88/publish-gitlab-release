# publish-gitlab-release

`publish-gitlab-release` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the process of creating a Git tag and a corresponding GitLab release.

It automates the collection of commits since the last tag, as well as all associated _merge requests_ and their linked _issues_.

The tool also facilitates adding comments to merge requests and their linked issues, providing better visibility into the changes included in each release.
Additionally, it generates a basic changelog based on raw commit messages.

These features are all also available in tools like [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), but the difference is that those enforce you to use semantiv versioning.
This tool doesn't care about your versioning scheme and only works for Gitlab via their API.

## üåü Features

- Create a git tag and publish a gitlab release
- Release comment on Merge Requests and their linked issues
- Basic Changelog on Gitlab Release

To use publish-gitlab-release, you can easily invoke it with npx as follows:
