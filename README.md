# publish-gitlab-release

`publish-gitlab-release` is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of creating a Git tag and a corresponding GitLab release.

The tool automates the collection of commits made since the last tag, along with all associated merge requests and their linked issues.
It also adds comments to merge requests and their linked issues, providing better visibility into the changes included in each release.
Additionally, it generates a basic changelog based on raw commit messages.

Unlike some other tools like [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), `publish-gitlab-release` doesn't enforce a specific versioning scheme. It is flexible and works exclusively with GitLab via their API.

## üåü Features

- Create a Git tag and publish a GitLab release with a single command.
- Automatically add comments to Merge Requests and their linked issues for better visibility.
- Generate a basic changelog for the GitLab release.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Node 18 (or higher)
- Gitlab
- Your latest Git tag is always the tag since last release

## üöÄ Usage

To use `publish-gitlab-release`, invoke it using npx with the desired version number:

```bash
npx publish-gitlab-release -v "1.2.3" [options]
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Options

#### `-v, --version` _(required)_

Specifies the version name to be used for the Git tag and the Gitlab release. This option is required and should be used to define the version of the release.

#### `-t, --token` _(optional)_

Gitlab API token. If provided, the tool will use this token to authenticate with Gitlab when creating the release. If not provided, the tool will attempt to use the environment variable `CI_JOB_TOKEN` within Gitlab pipelines.

#### `--ref` _(optional)_

Git ref that should be tagged. If provided, the specified Git ref will be tagged with the version defined using the `-v` option. If not provided, the tool will use the given environment variable `CI_COMMIT_SHA` from Gitlab pipelines.

#### `--host` _(optional)_

Gitlab URI. Use this option to specify a custom Gitlab host URL. Within Gitlab pipelines the tool will use the environment variables `CI_SERVER_PROTOCOL`, `CI_SERVER_HOST` and `CI_SERVER_PORT`. Fallback is `gitlab.com`.

#### `--project` _(optional)_

Gitlab project ID. Use this option to specify the ID of the Gitlab project where the release should be published. If not provided, the tool will use the given variable `CI_PROJECT_ID` from Gitlab pipelines.
